**Challenge Details**

It is a powerful scripting language created in Jan 1999 for Microsoft Windows, you can do a lot of amazing things with like creating the new notepad ðŸ¤¡

If you encounter Anti Virus threat alert from your antivirus, please run it in a sandbox environment.

**Key concepts**

Static reverse engineering (Strings, Ghidra, Ida), AutoIt Reversing, Sandboxing, Malware Analysis, Dynamic Debugging

**Learning Objectives**

Participants will learn about malware analysis such running the sample in sandbox environment, performing static analysis on the binary sample to recover strings to discover that its a autoit binary.

If participants were to perform advanced  static analysis/dynamically debug the binary (Rabbit Hole) using Ida/Ghidra/WinDbg, they will also learn about concepts such as anti debugging

Then, participants will learn about deofuscating code as they analyse the recovered au3 script to get back the flag
