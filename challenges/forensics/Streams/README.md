# Challenge Details

1,2,3...10 sussy looking logs. Our blue team defenders told us that we are under attack via sophisticated malware techniques. What other things are they hidding from us ðŸ˜µðŸ’€ Hmmm maybe the logs are just a distraction, who knows?

# Key Concepts

Alternative Data Streams, Malware, Python Programming, Log Analysis

**Learning Objectives**

In the first part of the challenge, participants can understand that there are ways to hide data, such as via alternative data streams.

In the second part of the challenge, participants can recover the python program (From logs 1,2,3 ... 10), and run it. Add an addition line of python code or use online decimal to ascii converter such as rapidtables.com

The logs are there as distraction!

# Solution

Find hidden data streams in the log files:

`dir \R`

Recover back the hidden python program (join back all the 10 lines of the program), and run the program, print out the lol array:

`print("".join(lol))`
