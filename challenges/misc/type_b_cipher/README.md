**Challenge Details**

Enigma is a widely recognized encryption method employed by the Germans during World War II. However, it's worth noting that the Japanese utilized a distinct cipher system. Referred to as "PURPLE" by the Allies, this encryption apparatus was pivotal for encoding exceedingly confidential diplomatic and military correspondences.

Contained herein is an ostensibly authentic ciphertext dispatched during the war period, the veil of secrecy surrounding its purpose remaining enigmatic. Are you inclined to undertake the challenge of deciphering this code?

**Solution **

1. Find & read https://cryptocellar.org/simula/purple/index.html
2. Run the PURPLE simulator in a x86 OS
3. Set it to decipher mode
4. Configure switch settings to 02 03 05 07
5. Enter ciphertext to get the corresponding plaintext

**Learning Objectives**

This challenge exposes participants to WWII era ciphers, other than the widely known Enigma.
